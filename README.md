# Social Media Content Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing publicly available social media content to identify patterns, contextual meaning, and potential physical security indicators. The objective is to simulate real-world OSINT-style monitoring where analysts review open-source platforms to identify relevant information related to public safety, social trends, and situational awareness.

The analysis is performed using structured observation methods, documentation, and reporting techniques commonly used in intelligence and monitoring roles.
